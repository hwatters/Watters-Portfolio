### Line Chart vs. Scatter Plot
I thought the best way to present the data in a different form was through a scatter plot. The first change I made was rearranging the countries alphabetically to give some order to the data. By using a scatter plot, all the data can be presented in one chart rather than many (line), so it makes it easier for the reader to compare across countries. I also changed the y-axis to the years instead of the debt to GDP ratio. By having time as my y-axis, I was able to use a red-yellow-green coloring. This type of coloring is familiar to audiences, knowing that red is “bad”, yellow “better”, and green “good”. For example, by looking at the scatter plot the reader can easily identify that Japan’s debt to GDP ratio has been getting consistently better, growing in the right (green) direction. Whereas Belgium started out higher (light green), then their ratio dipped (red/orange), and is now slowing improving (yellow). I also made sure to include a legend at the bottom of the chart so the color scale can be verified. I think that this data works well in an interactive scatter plot. By highlighting over the data points, which may be difficult to read at times, readers as able to see the specific readings.
