# About me
Hi, my name is Hannah Watters. I am a part-time student working towards a master's degree in public management. I started in the Heinz College in Spring 2020 and I hope to complete my degree in 2022. Outside of the online classroom, I work full-time at Carnegie Mellon in the Advancement Department as an assistant director of Advancement Research. In this position, I focus on prospecting Carnegie Mellon alums and friends who may be interested in giving back to the institution. The role involves a lot of writing, creativity, strategy development, and more recently, data visualization. 
Before joining CMU in April 2019, I worked four years at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh where my role focused on prospect research and management for the four museums. Originally from mid-central Ohio, I came to Pittsburgh to attend Duquesne University, where I earned a B.A. degree in art history. I currently live in Morningside with my husband and rambunctious pug, Remy.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to better my data visualization skills to help me excel in my professional career.
