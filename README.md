# Watters-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data.

# About me
Hi, my name is Hannah Watters. I am a part-time student working towards a master's degree in public management. I started in the Heinz College in Spring 2020 and I hope to complete my degree in 2022. Outside of the online classroom, I work full-time at Carnegie Mellon in the Advancement Department as an assistant director of Advancement Research. In this position, I focus on prospecting Carnegie Mellon alumni and friends who may be interested in giving back to the institution. The role involves a lot of writing, creativity, strategy development, and more recently, data visualization. 

Before joining CMU in April 2019, I worked four years at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. My role at the museums also focused on prospect research and management. Originally from mid-central Ohio, I came to Pittsburgh to attend Duquesne University. At Duquesne, I earned a B.A. degree in art history and a minor in business. I currently live in Morningside with my husband and rambunctious pug, Remy.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to better my data visualization skills to help me excel in my professional career. The field of non-profit prospect development is evolving quickly. Many institutions are turning towards new technology to keep up with trends, such as BI software. I hope to learn how to create powerful data visualizations that are easy to interpret, especially to audiences who are reluctant to change (i.e. colleagues who keep paper records). I hope to gain from the course the confidence to present data in a powerful and productive way.
