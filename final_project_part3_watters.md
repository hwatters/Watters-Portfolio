My intended audience is the museum visitor and museum professionals. I wanted to point out the disparities museums have as a whole. I presented three areas in which museums have room to improve. I want to share this information with visitors because it can be something that is easily missed. If they are not looking at the artwork labels for the artist and provenance, they are missing part of the story. Many museums are not calling out the gaps in their collections. I also want to share this information with museum professionals, as they are the ones that can make the change a reality. This presentation of data will hopefully point out the areas in their institutions that need fixed.

The final project I created has truly evolved since I started my early drafts. I originally was just going to focus on visitation and how it compared to communities the museums were located, but I was unable to find the data set I needed. After reading some articles and recalling on my personal experience as a past museum professional, I concluded that their was actually a bigger story to share. When looking at diversity disparities as a whole in musuems, it is quite shocking. When I showed my drafts to friends and family, they were all shocked that museums had such white, male collections. In the beginning of my drafting I worried that I was trying to take on too much information, listing the three areas where diversity was needed, but I think it all worked together to tell the entire story. 

Design wise, I was pleased. Since my data was majority ratios of populations, I felt I did not have an opportunity to use a variety of graphs. I wanted to present my data creatively, but I also wanted it to be accessible and clean. I mostly chose pie and bar charts to show ratios as I thought it did not over complicate the data. I also stuck to a cool color scheme throughout the entire presentation. I think my choice of cool blues, greens, and grays make it easy to look at and is not distracting to the eye. I also did not want to overcomplicate the formatting and design of my Shorthand. The platform offers a lot of variations on how to present information, but I wanted to keep it simple and less dramatic.
