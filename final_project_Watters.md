# Final Project

## Outline
Before my current job, I worked for a museum for four years. During this time I worked closely with the membership department whereI became aware of the disparity of museum visitors and its members. Museum visitor demographics do not match the demographics across the United States. Visitors tend to white and come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, whereas in the furture this current visitor group is expected to be a minority. I am interested in showing the reader who is visiting museums and how these current visitation numbers are predicted to change. I envision my call to action to be on how museums can lessen the divide, such as diversifying leadership and artists. I originally planned on picking a specific city (i.e. New York) and comparing its visitation to its community, but I was unable to find the data I needed. I have modified it to emcompass all museums and their visitors.

## Initial Sketches


## The Data
I plan on using information and data provided by the American Association of Museums. In 2010 they published a report with findings about past and present visitor demographics, as well as what they predicted for the future. I also plan on using current population data and recent articles about changes in museum leadership.

## The Plan
I plan on using Shorthand to create my final project. Based on the demostration that Trista did in class, I think it will present my information well. I will hopefully use Tableau and Flourish to recreate my data visualizations. I will also most likely use images to go with my text and visualizations. I do not have any experience in Shorthand. Though it will be challenging, I think it will help me tell my story and call to action.
